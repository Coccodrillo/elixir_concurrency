## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

  1. Add basic_message_passing to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

        def deps do
          [{:basic_message_passing, "~> 0.0.1"}]
        end

  2. Ensure basic_message_passing is started before your application:

        def application do
          [applications: [:basic_message_passing]]
        end
